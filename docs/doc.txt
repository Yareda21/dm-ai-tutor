# Yared Coding — Ingestion Document for RAG

This file is a clean, ingestion-ready plaintext dataset meant to be directly indexed into your vector database. Each document chunk below follows a strict, machine-friendly format so the RAG pipeline can parse metadata and text easily.

FORMAT SPEC (use this exact template for automated ingestion):

\---DOC\_START---
id: <uuid-or-slug>
source\_url: \<full URL if public, or "private:/..." if private>
title: <short title>
author: <name or organization>
published\_date: <YYYY-MM-DD or null>
language: \<en | am>
tags: <comma-separated tags>
summary: <one-sentence summary>

\<full text content (no lines starting with '---DOC\_' )>
\---DOC\_END---

Notes:

* Keep each content block around 200–500 words (or 200–400 tokens) when possible.
* Use `language` metadata to indicate Amharic chunks (am) vs English (en).
* For private/student data, set source\_url to a private namespace (e.g., private:/students/<id>/notes) and DO NOT expose publicly.
* Include clear `published_date` when available to help recency-aware retrievers.

title: AI Tutor System — RAG + Pinecone + OpenAI
author: Yared Coding

language: en
tags: project, ai, rag, pinecone
summary: An AI tutor integrating vector search and OpenAI models to answer student questions using school content and course materials.
content:
The AI Tutor project uses a RAG architecture: documents (course notes, blog posts, transcripts) are chunked, embedded, and indexed into a vector DB (e.g., Pinecone). The API retrieves relevant chunks and augments LLM prompts with citations. The system uses Firebase for authentication, n8n for automation, and Langflow/LangGraph agents for orchestration. The project is designed to answer in English and Amharic and prioritize evidence-backed answers.

published\_date: 2025-09-10
language: en
tags: ingestion, guidelines
summary: Rules for splitting, metadata, and language handling for indexing Yared Coding content.
content:

1. Chunk size: aim for 200–400 tokens (roughly 100–300 words). Overlap: 20–30%.
2. Metadata required: id, source\_url, title, author, published\_date, language, tags, summary.
3. Language: set language=en for English text, language=am for Amharic. When possible, include both language versions as separate chunks.
4. Private data: use private:/ namespace and do not expose without consent.
5. Citation: store `source_url` and `position_index` in metadata so answers can include precise citations.
6. Embeddings: use multilingual embeddings that support Amharic or transliterate Amharic text before embedding if necessary.
